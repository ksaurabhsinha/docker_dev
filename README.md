# Docker Dev

This is the LEMP (Linux, Enginx, MySQL, PHP) docker setup I use for development.

### Clone the repository

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ksaurabhsinha/docker_dev.git
```

Customize the configuration by renaming the `.env.example` to `.env` and edit acording to your requirements.

### Initialize the setup

```sh
make install
```

Enjoy
